# War
This is a project developed for CIS170. The code plays the card game "War". 
The only variation of this game is that when the players tie (draw a card of the same number),
both players lose the round and discard that number. 
The cards are ranked from "Ace" as the lowest card and "King" as the highest card.
I also decided to make the entire game automated since playing the game by rounds 
would take a long time.
